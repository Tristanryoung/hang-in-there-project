# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
* We built a webpage that generates posters, which each include one image, one title, and one quote. That poster can be generated randomly, or created from user input. Posters can then be saved, displayed on a saved page, and deleted from the saved page upon double-click. This application is able to manipulate and show behind-the-scenes data in a way that's navigable and understandable for a human user. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
* A user would need to fork our GitHub repository, clone it down to their local machine, open it in VS code, and then run the command `open index.html`. From there, the application would open in their browser fully functional. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
* We completed this project between Tuesday, February 7th and Sunday, February 12th. We were both in Mod1 at the time, approximately two weeks in. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
* This project was completed by [Tristan Young](https://github.com/Tristanryoung) and [Em Lindvall](https://github.com/emlindvall).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* This project combined every single aspect of coding we've learned so far at Turing, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It proved that we can do this, and taught us how to communicate between HTML, CSS, and Javascript fluidly. It also helped solidify and strengthen our teamworking skills and our GitHub workflow. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins
* We completed the application with full functionality, even though it was overwhelming. 
* We communicated really transparently as partners, showed up 100%, and gave each other grace when needed. 
* We successfully fell back on our community resources (e.g. cohort group, rocks, peer mentors) when we hit roadblocks in order to overcome them. 
### Challenges
* There were certain iterations where it was difficult to find a solid place to start coding, especially Iteration 4. 
* GitHub is still challenging, and we could probably both use additional practice in this area.
